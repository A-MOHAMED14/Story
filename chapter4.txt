As the pirates departed with bellies full,
They praised the chef, his culinary pull.
But as they sailed away into the night,
They soon felt their thirst with all their might.

Their throats were dry, their lips were parched,
Their tongues felt like they'd been harshly marched.
They cursed the chef for his salty brew,
For now they longed for water, too!

With a chuckle, the chef waved them goodbye,
As they sailed off under the starry sky.
For though his soup was a salty surprise,
It left the pirates with watery eyes!
