In a kitchen full of clatter,
Lived a chef who loved to chatter.
With pots and pans, he'd clang and bang,
Creating meals with a joyful twang.

But one day, in his cooking spree,
He added salt instead of tea!
With a gulp, he tasted his creation,
And found it fit for a briny ocean.

He stirred and whisked with all his might,
Trying to fix the salty plight.
But alas, his dish was doomed to be,
A salty sea in a bowl, you see.
