He stirred and whisked with all his might,
Trying to fix the salty plight.
But alas, his dish was doomed to be,
A salty sea in a bowl, you see.

So with a shrug and a chuckle too,
He served it up with a hullabaloo.
His guests, they laughed and licked their lips,
For even salty soup can bring some quips!
