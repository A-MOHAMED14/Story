The pirates slurped and smacked their lips,
Exclaiming, "This soup's fit for ships!"
They praised the chef, not knowing the plot,
That they were eating soup from a salty pot!

With laughter and jest, they enjoyed the feast,
While the chef chuckled, his plan released.
For even with a culinary flop,
He turned salty soup into pirate's top!
